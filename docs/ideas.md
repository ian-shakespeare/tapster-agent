# Ideas

> This is an informal document to throw ideas at the wall and see if anything sticks

## Tapster

A personal bartender capable of searching for, saving, displaying, and exporting cocktail recipes. Bonus: Make it perform calorie calculations

### Pros:

- Simple interface, just a chat
- Can use multiple tools: SQL tool for saving data, Search engine tool for getting recipes, CSV or JSON tool for exporting

### Cons:

- May be too simple
- Hard to define performance metrics (really only consistency/accuracy)
- May be difficult to wrangle multiple tools at the same time

## Noto

An intelligent note taking app that can transform any notes into markdown, HTML, LaTeX (maybe Typst?)

### Pros:

- Easy to define performance metrics (consistency, output quality)
- Likely quite easy to implement

### Cons:

- Even more simple than Tapster
- Very niche use-case that doesn't necessarily fit an LLM well
- Annoying to validate

## Idea Guy

An app for generating ideas. Whether that be product concepts, writing prompts, or even where to eat for dinner

### Pros:

- Lots of room to expand (example: add a maps integration to find places related to ideas)
- Something I'd very likely use

### Cons:

- Loose requirements means harder to define
- Scope can quickly balloon out of control


## Decision Time

While I could try to come up with more ideas, and probably find a better one, I'm actually quite fond of __Tapster__.
I think there's enough depth to the idea that I could easily make it quite complex, but could also scale it down to something simpler.
Coming up with a PEAS assessment may be difficult, but neither of the other two options will be much better.
